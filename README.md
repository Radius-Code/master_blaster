# master_blaster
A program to launch blast multiple times to get homologous of proteins in sucesive sequences. 

To launch the program open launcher.py in vscode and run it.
First input a sequence and the organism corresponding to it and launch the program, so you obtain homologous of that sequence and homologous of those homologous in sucesive intents.

It will generate multiple archives (.xml to parse and .csv to get the sequences) to obtain the homologous sequences and at the end it will ask you for remove those files. You have to read final_report.txt to see all final homologous proteins.
